It has been a great (ly terrifying) week learning how to use a computer.  I am both mystified by how far technology and computer engineering has come and how archaic and chaotic everything still seems. As consumer and regular user of tech products, I love seeing the advances that terrific UI has made and feel a great sense of progress. As I peel back the layers of technology I see how many "hacks" there are and the myriad programs to skin the cat du jour.
